## Overview

This repository hosts a **Multiple Disease Prediction System** built with Streamlit and machine learning models. The application allows users to predict the likelihood of several diseases, including:

- **Diabetes**  
- **Heart Disease**  
- **Parkinson's Disease**  
- **Breast Cancer**  
- **Stroke**

Each prediction model is based on a trained machine learning algorithm, providing users with actionable results and preventive measures.

---

## Features

1. **User-friendly Interface**: Navigate through different prediction modules from the sidebar.  
2. **Disease-specific Inputs**: Input data required for each diseaseâ€™s prediction.  
3. **Actionable Results**: Get results along with recommended precautions based on the prediction.  

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kumar19Aditya/multiple-disease-prediction.git
   cd multiple-disease-prediction
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run finalproject.py
   ```

## Application Structure

### Sidebar Navigation
- Choose between five prediction modules:
  - **Diabetes Prediction**  
  - **Heart Disease Prediction**  
  - **Parkinson's Prediction**  
  - **Breast Cancer Prediction**  
  - **Stroke Prediction**

---

## Models Used

- **Diabetes Model**: `final_diabetic_model_project.sav`
- **Heart Disease Model**: `final_heart_disease_model_project.sav`
- **Parkinsonâ€™s Model**: `final_parkinsons_model_project.sav`
- **Breast Cancer Model**: `final_breast_cancer_model_project.sav`
- **Stroke Model**: `final_stroke_model_project.sav`

Make sure the `.sav` files are placed in the specified directory path to ensure proper functionality.

## Precautions (Sample for Diabetes)

If the person is diabetic:
- **Diet**: Focus on balanced meals, limit sugary foods.  
- **Exercise**: Engage in regular physical activity.  
- **Monitoring**: Check blood sugar levels regularly.  
- **Lifestyle**: Avoid smoking, limit alcohol, manage stress.
